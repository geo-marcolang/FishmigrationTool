# FishmigrationTool

The tool was developed in the context of the master thesis with the title Modelling of fish passability of watercourses at low water discharges. The tool shows the thalweg as well as other parameters of fishability based on hydraulic modelling and with principles of network theory. For the execution there is a GUI interface.

see the tutorial - Benutzerhandbuch_Fischdurchg√§ngigkeitstool_Marco Lang (german) for more info.

### Running the script

Download and unzip the Github Repository to a In your command line program of choice (i.e. Windows command prompt, Anaconda prompt)

- Change the directory cd c:\... to the unzipped repository
- Run the script with python py_Fishmigrationtool_alone.py or python py_Fishmigrationtool_several.py

### Requirements

- Input data is required in BASEMENT version 2.7 or 2.8 format. However, the script is constantly being adapted so that input  data in other formats can soon be processed. (https://basement.ethz.ch/)
- Python v3.x (written in 3.6 & 3.7)
- Required Libraries: networkx, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tkinter

** I use Anaconda Python that has all the required libraries (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

### Output

The picture shows the manually measured thalweg and the thalwege generated by the Fishmigration-Tool using hydraulic modelling. Weighting 1 (Gewichtung1) is the shortest thalweg and weighting 2 (Gewichtung2) the deepest thalweg. The different water depths are shown with different colours.
